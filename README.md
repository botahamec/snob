# Snob

This is a library that serves to make parsing strings a bit easier. I use this
to easily write tokenizers. This was inspired by the Icon programming language,
which in turn was inspired by SNOBOL. That's how this library came to be known
as snob.

## Usage

The minimum supported Rust version for this library is 1.66.1.

To use this in your crate, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
# ...
snob = "0.1"
```
